The SEEDLabs assignments used an Ubuntu 16-04 VM on Virtual Box. The VM and its contents were designed to be vulnerable to certain attacks.
SEED machines are excellent for practicing offensive and defensive security. The files in this folder include a vulnerable retlib program,
a program to find our environment variable we created MYSHELL, and the exploit code itself

SEEDLabs began in 2003 with Dr. Wenliang Du as the project lead. With initial funding from Syracuse University and the National Science
Foundation, the goal was the develop instructional operating systems to bolster computer security education, receiving several
grants for the large scale dissemination of the labs. Try them if you get the time!
