# Books

I like to keep a reading list for anything I find interesting, figured I'd post some of them here. I don't restrict myself to any particular topics, though I do tend to lean towards nonfiction. I'll try to categorize books as best I can.

I'll start with books related to computers and technology; after all, this is GitHub.
