$whoami

    I'm Andy. I went to UIUC and graduated with a bachelors in International Relations.
    
    While there I took coursework on international security, diplomacy, history, and 
    literature of the Russian language. I often read about these subjects when I have the chance. 
    I love coding, but more than that, I love learning how to code. I love learning in general and 
    have an insatiable desire to be a permanent, full-time, fully-insured student. My first
    action once I win the lottery will be in pursuit of this goal.

    Currently I'm getting a Masters degree in the Department of Enginnering, Computing, and 
    Mathematical Sciences at Lewis University. Contextual security is my prime focus, 
    specifically the political and ideological relationships of ATPs. I also am interested in
    operating systems design and security, cyber-physical systems security, and programming 
    embedded systems.

$cat os_hardware

    Like most, my computer journey began on Windows with occassional Mac usage in middle and 
    high school. My first personal laptop was a Chromebook. The most technically 
    sophisticated thing I could is force my friends' Chromebooks to force shut down by 
    hitting the top row of keys with my forearm.

    My next laptop was for university. At the time I didn't require too much fluff, so it had 
    4 GB of RAM and sounded like a small and modest F-35 fighter jet. I don't want to put the 
    blame on Windows 10, but also... I mean, you know if you know. 

    I installed a lightweight Linux distro (Arch) after wiping Windows 10 and that low-ram 
    laptop is now my pride and joy. I love using it as a convenient little coding medium.

    I currently daily drive Windows 11 (but pretty much only use it to spin up Linux VMs at 
    this point) and Arch Linux, and it's made my computing experience all the more enjoyable 
    and educational.
