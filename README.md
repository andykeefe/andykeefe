$whoami

    I'm Andy. I went to UIUC and graduated with a bachelors in International Relations. While there I studied international relations.
    While there I took coursework on international security, diplomacy, history, and literature of the Russian language. I often read 
    about these subjects when I have the chance. I love coding despite only doing it since I 2018, but more than that, I love learning
    how to code. I love learning in general and have an insatiable desire to be a permanent, full-time, fully-insured student. My first
    action once I win the lottery will be in pursuit of this goal. 

$head academic_interests

    Currently I'm getting a Masters degree in the Department of Enginnering, Computing, and Mathematical Sciences at Lewis University.
    Contextual security is my prime focus, specifically the political and ideological relationships of ATPs. I also am interested in
    operating systems design and security, cyber-physical systems security, and programming embedded systems. I also love learning
    about cryptography and am seeking to further develop my algorithmic thinking.
