## $whoami

Andy (human). 
    
I took coursework on international security, diplomacy, history, and 
literature of the Russian language. I often read about these subjects when I have the chance. 
I love coding, but more than that, I love learning how to code. I love learning in general and 
have an insatiable desire to be a permanent, full-time, fully-insured student. My first
action once I win the lottery will be in pursuit of this goal. 

## $head academic_interests

Currently I'm pursuing a Masters degree in the Department of Enginnering, Computing, and 
Mathematical Sciences at Lewis University. It's been a lot of fun and just a little bit 
of stress. I enjoy the academic nature of the program, but I'm always looking for ways
to apply the stuff I've learned in a more practical manner.

## $pwd 

While I'm doing my grad degree, I'm working in a public library. I love books and I love
being friendly, so it works really well. Working there has guilted me into reading more,
which is always a good thing. It's always fun to see people coming in looking for books
on computers, security, and other tech stuff.
