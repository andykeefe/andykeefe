Basics
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The authors call this a qualifying set. It gets you ready to write and think like a cryptographer. It requires a level of knowledge beyond just introductory coding, and it's definitely necessary to have open documentation for Python while doing it.

The exercises prescribed are as follows:
1. Convert hex to base64
2. Fixed XOR
3. Single-byte XOR cipher
4. Detect single character XOR
5. Implementing repeating key XOR
6. Break repeating key XOR
7. AES in ECB mode
8. Detect AES in ECB mode
