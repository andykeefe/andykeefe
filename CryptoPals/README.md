This directory has code I used to solve several CryptoPals exercises. CryptoPals was designed to demonstrate attacks on cryptography in the real world. I heard about this from open-source Go maintainer Filippo Valsorda and decide to give it a shot.

As always, I heavily comment my code so that anyone who wants to read it for educational purposes can understand what I've written a little better.
