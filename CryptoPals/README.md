CryptoPals
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This directory has code I used to solve several CryptoPals exercises. CryptoPals was designed to demonstrate attacks on cryptography in the real world. I heard about this from open-source Go maintainer Filippo Valsorda and decide to give it a shot. Currently all of the code will be written in Python; I'm trying to improve my Python skills, and this is a good opportunity for it. However, once I feel I'm able, I will try these problems in another language. I'm deciding between the following:
- C
- C++
- Java
- Go
- Rust

I've little experience with Go and Rust, so this might be a good opportunity to branch out into a fresh, exciting language. 

As always, I heavily comment my code so that anyone who wants to read it for educational purposes can understand what I've written a little better. I do intend to show some of these exercises to students, especially in my Application Security class in Fall 2024. Maybe they can help me a little bit, too. :)
