Number Theoretic Cryptography
------------------------------------

The last four sets have dealt with symmetric cryptography, for example, block ciphers like AES, and MACs using symmetric keys. Symmetric cryptography has been the standard for thousands of years. Now we're getting into the newer, far more mathematical field of asymmetric cryptography, or public key cryptography. Public key algorithms rely on three types of computational problems:
1. Integer factorization: RSA is based on this, for example
2. Discrete logarithms in finite fields: Diffie-Hellman is based on this, for example
3. Elliptic curve schemes: Elliptic Curve Diffie Hellman (ECDH) is based on this, for example
