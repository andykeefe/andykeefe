This directory contains code used for a introductory Python course I am teaching at my local library. The exercises are intended to "kick-off" 
someone's coding journey, not provide a comprehensive overview or even a foundational understanding of computer science principles. I'll leave
that to the learner. Also I'm definitely not the person who should be teaching computer science concepts. 

It begins with a "Hello world!" program (as is tradition) and ends with a basic transposition cipher, all in Python. I also cover some basic 
cryptography terms just for the sake of fun, because what is more fun than cryptography? Nothing. Maybe basketball. 

    Exercise 1: Hello world
        first function, defining variables, tripping errors

    Exercise 2: No idea what to call this I'm afraid. Arithmetic stuff? 
        variable types (type() function), operators, standard functions

    Exercise 3: Conditional statements
        if-else, while, input() function, type conversion

    Exercise 4: Defining functions
        user-defined functions, calling functions, flow control
        with some jazz: importing modules, calling functions from imported modules, if __name__ == '__main__' convention

    Exercise 5: Lists
        arrays, indexing, type conversions

    Exercise 6: Transposition cipher
        cryptography concepts, for and while loops, passing variables to functions
