This directory contains code used for a introductory Python course I am teaching at my local library. The exercises are intended to "kick-off" 
someone's coding journey, not provide a comprehensive overview or even a foundational understanding of computer science principles. 

It begins with a "Hello world!" program (as is tradition) and ends with a basic transposition cipher, all in Python. I also cover some basic 
cryptography terms just for the sake of fun, because what is more fun than cryptography? The answer is nothing.
